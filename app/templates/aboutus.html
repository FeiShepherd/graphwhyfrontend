                    At GraphWhy, we are ‘building statistical understanding’. Our main goal is to build a database of people’s beliefs so that our society can have a public resource for understanding why our world is the way it is.

                    For example, a student is writing a paper on why our national debt has grown to the size that it is now. The student has access to economic and political theory, but he also wants to explore how U.S. citizens feel about the national debt. Using GraphWhy the student has a set of tools to explore how citizens feel about the national debt from statistical standpoint.
